# data-structures-and-algorithms
This repository contains a collection of implementations of common data structures and algorithms in C. 
 
## Data Structures
The data structures included in this repository are:
- Stack
- Array
- Binary tree
- Linked list

## Graph Traversal Algorithms

Graph traversal algorithms are algorithms for visiting every vertex in a graph. Included in this repo
- Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph by visiting the vertices in depth, implemented using a stack.
- Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph by visiting the vertices in breadth, implemented using a queue.
- Prim's algorithm: A greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree of a graph.
- Kruskal's algorithm: A greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree of a graph.
